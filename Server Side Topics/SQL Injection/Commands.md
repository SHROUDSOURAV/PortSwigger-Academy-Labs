## Retrieve Data, Subvert Application Logic

- Below are some examples of payloads. Whether they will work or not depends and not **GURANTEED**. We need to have an idea of the query made to the application's database based on which we need to make modifications of the below payloads.
### **PAYLOADS** :

```sql
--
-- '
' --
OR 1=1 --'

/*
Warning: Take care when injecting the condition `OR 1=1` into a SQL query. Even if it appears to be harmless in the context you're injecting into, it's common for applications to use data from a single request in multiple different queries. If your condition reaches an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement, for example, it can result in an accidental loss of data.

```


## Retrieve Data from Database Tables

- To retrieve data from other tables in the database we can use the `UNION` keyword to execute additional `SELECT` query and append those results to the original query to get more information.
### **Requirements** :

- Same number of columns need to be selected in `SELECT` statements to use `UNION`.
- The columns must have same datatype.
- The columns must have the same order. For example : `table1 -> col1=int col2=string then table2 col1=string col2=int will give error. order same, datatype same, position matters  so => table2 -> col2=string col1=int will be right`.


#### 1. Determine number of columns required

- **METHOD 1** :
	- Use the `ORDER BY` clause and increasing the number by `1` each time until we hit an error to understand the number of columns returned by the original query. The number where we hit the error subtract `-1` to get number of columns. For example : `error at 3 so total columns = 3 - 1 = 2`.

```sql
' ORDER BY 1--
```


- **METHOD 2** :
	- Involves submitting a series of `UNION SELECT` payloads specifying a different number of null values. If the number of nulls does not match the number of columns, the database returns an error.

### **PAYLOADS :**

```sql
UNION SELECT <columns to check> FROM <table name>
```
